Melanocytic nevi;"Melanocytic nevus is the medical term for a mole. Nevi can appear anywhere on the body. They are benign (non-cancerous) and typically do not require treatment. A very small percentage of melanocytic nevi may develop a melanoma? within them. Of note  the majority of cutaneous melanomas arise within normally appearing skin. Benign nevi are usually a single color  ranging from skin-colored to dark brown. They are typically round or oval-shaped. In addition  benign moles are symmetric  that is  when a line is drawn within them  the two halves have the same appearance. Most melanocytic nevi are the size of a pencil eraser or smaller. When larger in size  they may be referred to as atypical nevi or they may represent moles present since birth (congenital nevi). About 1 in 100 babies are born with a congenital nevus. ?Nevi begin to appear during childhood and increase in number until early to mid-adulthood. As nevi age  they can become elevated but also soft"". If a nevus becomes elevated and is firm to the touch  it should receive medical attention. When there is a suspicion of cutaneous melanoma  a biopsy will be performed.?";Melanocytic nevi are benign tumors that that arise in the skin. They have different sizes and colors as outlined above. Benign nevi are usually round or oval-shaped and are uniform in color. There are more nevi in areas of the body that have greater long-term exposure to the sun  such as the outer arm compared with the inner arm. Cells within the skin called melanocytes produce a pigment named melanin. This pigment is what gives melanocytic nevi a tan to dark brown color. Melanin is also responsible for overall skin color and the darkening seen with a sun tan.;Melanocytic nevi are a reflection of genetic factors  such as family history  and environmental factors primarily  sun exposure.;Tan to dark brown  pale pink  and occasionally black in color. Round or oval in shape. Smooth borders. Uniform color throughout. Symmetry (when a line is drawn within them  the two halves have the same appearance). As melanocytic nevi age  they often become lighter in color. They may also elevate but should become softer to the touch.;The majority of melanocytic nevi do not require treatment. Nevi that are benign but bothersome to the patient because of appearance or irritation can be removed. Moles are removed by the shave technique or suture surgery. Atypical melanocytic nevi are biopsied when the clinician is concerned about the possibility of cutaneous melanoma.
Melanoma;Too much time in the sun or aÿtanning booth in your youth might make you worry about skin cancer  especially the most serious form called melanom. It is a type of skin cancer that originates in the pigment-producing cells of the epidermis called melanocytes. Of the three most common types of skin cancer  melanoma is the most dangerous. It's much more likely to spread than basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma to spread.  Melanoma accounts for only one percent of skin cancer cases but causes a large majority of skin cancer deaths. Rates of melanoma have been rising for at least 30 years. About 96 000 new cases of melanoma are expected to be diagnosed this year. ;As with other types of skin cancer  exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation  from the sun or tanning beds  is a major risk factor for melanoma. Skin color matters  too. There's an inverse relationship between the amount of pigment in a person's skin and his or her risk of melanoma. Not all melanomas are UV related. There's also a genetic component  which involves abnormalities in the gene that directs the body's production of the protective skin pigment known as melanin. Researchers have found that people who have abnormalities in this gene and have red hair and fair skin have a fourfold increased melanoma risk. About 10 percent of all people with melanoma have a family history of the disease (meaning that a parent  brother  sister or child has melanoma). The risk of melanoma increases as people age  says Dr. Leffell says. The average age at diagnosis is 62 but  notes Dr. Leffell  melanoma occurs in those under 30  too  and it is one of the most common cancers in young adults?especially young women. (Melanoma that runs in families may occur at a younger age.) ;Family history of melanoma. Personal history of melanoma or atypical (dysplastic) mole.  Fair skin. A tendency to burn rather than tan. Sensitivity to the sun. Freckles. Red/blond/light brown hair. Green/gray/blue eyes. Excessive sun exposure. New or changing moles.;"The most important warning sign for melanoma is a new spot on the skin or a spot that?s changing in size  shape or color. A spot that looks different from all of the other spots on someone?s skin (for example ÿit's darker than the frecklesÿor it has a different shape than the other moles) is also something to bring up to a dermatologist. While common moles do not turn into melanoma  an ""atypical nevus"" mole can transform into this kind of cancer  says Dr. Leffell. Self-examination for melanoma is a good place to start  but Dr. Leffell highlights change in color as an important factor. People should look for moles that fit this description: Asymmetry: If you fold the mole over in your mind's eye  the halves won't match  he says. Border irregularity: The edges of the mole are ragged  notched or blurred  not smooth like normal moles. Color irregularity: There are shades of tan  brown and black. Even red  white and blue can add to the mottled appearance. Diameter: A mole with a diameter greater than a pencil eraser (about five to six millimeters) should raise suspicion. The most common location for a melanoma to appear is on the back. Men are also highly susceptible to melanomas on the chest or abdomen  while women develop melanomas on the legs more often than do men. Catching malignant melanoma early makes all the difference in terms of being able to treat it. According to the Journal of the National Cancer Institute  people who check themselves for changes in existing moles or new growths and abnormalities are 44 percent less likely to die from melanoma. ";Treatment options are based on the stage of the cancer and other factors. Those factors are identified on the biopsy and include degree of inflammation  how quickly the cells seem to be dividing  and other features. Early-stage melanomas that haven't grown deeper than one millimeter can be completely treated with office-based excision  or surgical removal. ?Ninety-six percent of early-stage melanomas are cured with simple surgery ? says Dr. Leffell. In those cases  the doctor uses a procedure known as a wide excision to remove the melanoma and a margin of skin and tissue extending 1 to 2 centimeters around it to ensure that all of the cancer is removed. f the melanoma at the time of diagnosis is deeper than one millimeter or has some concerning features on biopsy  a more complex workup will be required.  perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy to determine if the melanoma has spread. The sentinel lymph node is the first node where the cancer would be expected to spread  given the flow of the body?s lymphatic system. If that node is clear  meaning there are no cancer cells in it  then it is unlikely that the cancer has spread to other nearby lymph nodes  and further surgery on the lymph nodes is not required. If melanoma is found in the sentinel lymph node  doctors may choose to monitor the status of the other lymph nodes using periodic imaging tests. In other cases  though  the surgeon may remove the remaining lymph nodes in a more extensive procedure called lymph node dissection. For more advanced cases of melanoma that have metastasized  treatment options include excision plus immunotherapy  targeted therapy  chemotherapy  or radiation therapy (sometimes more than one treatment is used). 
Benign keratosis-like lesions;"Seborrheic keratosis is the most common type of benign skin lesion. About 80 million Americans have one or more of these non-cancerous growths on their skin. Seborrheic keratosis growths can appear anywhere on your body  but they most commonly arise on sun-exposed areas of your skin  such as the face  head  neck  chest  back  arms  or legs. These spots can vary in size  from about the size of a pencil eraser to the size of a quarter (about an inch) or even larger. Although they can affect teenagers or young adults  the growths are most common among adults aged 50 and older. They occur more frequently with age; more than 90% of adults aged 65 and older are believed to have at least one seborrheic keratosis. Men and women are affected equally. Importantly  seborrheic keratosis is a benign condition; the growths do not become cancerous and therefore do not require treatment. However  some people opt to have the spots removed for cosmetic reasons or if the spots become irritated or inflamed because of their location and/or trauma.";"Seborrheic keratosis is a type of benign (non-cancerous) skin tumor or growth. These slow-growing spots are typically raised and sometimes have a rough texture. Some look similar to warts. They also vary in number; some people have a single seborrheic keratosis  while others have several  dozens  or even hundreds of spots on their skin. These growths are neither viral or bacterial and  therefore  cannot spread. Seborrheic keratosis occurs when immature skin cells  known as keratinocytes  multiply rapidly  resulting in a non-cancerous growth. This can occur in people with a family history of the condition  or it may affect people who have spent a significant amount of time in the sun. In rare instances  a person can suddenly develop a significant number of seborrheic keratosis growths. Although exceedingly rare  this may signal what?s known as the ?Leser-Tr‚lat sign ? which indicates that a person might have gastrointestinal cancer?  lung cancer?  lymphoma?  or leukemia?. Anyone thought to have the Leser-Tr‚lat sign should see a specialist who can diagnose cancer. However  it?s important to know that the Leser-Tr‚lat sign is very uncommon and the vast majority of seborrheic keratosis growths are slow-growing and benign.";Doctors aren?t sure what causes seborrheic keratosis  but there is very likely a genetic component?certain genetic mutations have been linked to the condition. Sun exposure and changes in estrogen levels have also been linked to seborrheic keratosis. Possible causes of seborrheic keratosis include: A family history of seborrheic keratosis  Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genetic mutation  PIK3CA genetic mutation  Pregnancy  Hormone therapy;People with seborrheic keratosis may notice a spot or spots on their skin that: Are age 50 or older  Have fair skin  Have spent a significant amount of time sunbathing or with the skin exposed to the sun  Have a family history of seborrheic keratosis  Have an FGFR3 genetic mutation  Have a PIK3CA genetic mutation  Are pregnant  Have taken hormone therapy. Although these growths appear most often on people with fair skin  those with darker skin can also develop the condition. In people with darker skin  growths often appear on the upper cheeks  just beneath the eyes in what is often referred to as ?dermatosis papulosa nigra;"In most cases  no treatment is necessary for seborrheic keratosis. Sometimes  the growths are removed because their location leads to chronic irritation or bleeding. Other times  people choose to have them removed for cosmetic reasons. When a seborrheic keratosis is removed  options include: Cryotherapy  in which a growth is ?frozen off? the body  Electrosurgery  in which an electrical current is applied to the growth to remove it  Curettage  in which a special surgical tool is used to scrape the growth off the skin; Electrosurgery plus curettage is used in some cases  Laser treatment  in which light from a laser destroys the growth  Dermabrasion  in which a skin-resurfacing tool is applied to the skin to smooth away growths  Shaving or snipping off the growth with special tools."
basal cell carcinomas;If you findÿa suspicious spot or mole on your skin after having spent too much time in the sun over the years  you may be concerned about skin cancer.ÿAbout 80 percent of skin cancers are basal cell carcinomas (also called basal cell cancers). This is not only the most common type of skin cancer but also the most common cancer. ;Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that occurs when there is damage to the DNA of basal cells in the top layer  or epidermis  of the skin. They are called basal cells because they are the deepest cells in the epidermis. In normal skin  the basal cells are less than one one-hundredth of an inch deep  but once a cancer has developed  it will spread deeper. Basal cell carcinoma  squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma are all skin cancers caused by exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays?from natural and artificial sunlight. There's also a genetic condition called basal cell nevus or Gorlin syndrome  which can cause people to develop hundreds of basal cell skin cancers  but it's extremely rare. People at the highest risk for basal cell carcinoma tend to have fair or light-colored skin  a history of sun exposure and a tendency to sunburn quickly. Fair-skinned people have a 50 percent risk of developing basal skin cancer at some point in their lives  Dr. Christensen says. The cancer is the result of cumulative damage of years spent in the sun  and may take 20 years to manifest. Basal cell carcinoma spreads very slowly and very rarely will metastasize  Dr. Christensen says. But if it's not treated  basal cell carcinoma can continue to grow deeper under the skin and cause significant destruction to surrounding tissues. It can even become fatal. For example  an untreated basal cell carcinoma on the face can grow into the bones and  over time  directly into the brain ;People at the highest risk for basal cell carcinoma tend to have fair or light-colored skin  a history of sun exposure and a tendency to sunburn quickly. Fair-skinned people have a 50 percent risk of developing basal skin cancer at some point in their lives  Dr. Christensen says. The cancer is the result of cumulative damage of years spent in the sun  and may take 20 years to manifest. Although it's often more common in older people  it can occur in younger adults  too. Basal cell carcinoma  squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma are all skin cancers caused by exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays?from natural and artificial sunlight. There's also a genetic condition called basal cell nevus or Gorlin syndrome  which can cause people to develop hundreds of basal cell skin cancers  but it's extremely rare.;A basal cell carcinoma is a stubborn  persistent spot that usually appears on areas that have been exposed to the sun  such as the head  neck  chest  arms and legs. The spot may take one of several forms: an open sore  a reddish irritated patch  a shiny red bump or nodule  a pink growth  or a small scar-like patch. In some people  the condition may resemble psoriasis or eczema. The spot will sometimes bleed  scab and heal up after a week or two  then bleed or become irritated again. Experienced dermatologists can get a very good idea of whether a spot is a basal cell carcinoma just by looking at it  but a skin biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.;Most of the time  basal cell carcinoma remains in one single spot on the skin. The most common and effective treatments are local surgical procedures. Surgical excision: If the lesion is relatively small  situated on the torso  arms or legs  and the biopsy shows that it doesn't have significant risk of spreading  it can be treated in the dermatologist's office. The doctor may perform an excision with a scalpel that removes the tumor and some of the surrounding skin. Stitches are usually used to keep the wound closed. The doctor will probably remove them after about a week. If dissolvable stitches are also used  they will disappear on their own as the area heals over the next four weeks. There will often be some redness  and there may be a small scar  but it will fade over time. The cure rate with this technique is typically about 90 percent to 93 percent  but varies depending on the type of skin cancer and experience of the doctor performing the procedure. Electrodesiccation and curettage: Also known as ?scraping and burning ? this is a procedure in which the dermatologist anesthetizes the skin  scrapes out the tumor with a semi-sharp blade  then uses electricity and heat to seal off the edges of the skin around it. ?This procedure can be very effective for small  low-risk  superficial skin cancers  particularly on the trunk and extremities ? Dr. Christensen says. It will usually leave a small  round  pale scar. For basal cell cancers that are superficial and confined to the top layer of the skin  this treatment has up to a 90 percent cure rate. Mohs micrographic surgery: The most thorough method for treating basal cell cancer is a technique called Mohs micrographic surgery. This type of surgery is often used when the cancer is on the face  when the spot is greater than one centimeter  when it's recurrent  or when the doctor cannot easily determine the margins (edges) of the cancer. In Mohs surgery  a scalpel is used to remove thin pieces of the affected skin and tissue little by little in a series of stages. After each piece is removed  the patient waits while the dermatologist processes the sample and examines it under a microscope to make sure that the margins are clean and that no abnormal cells are left. Mohs surgery allows the surgeon to be more precise without affecting any more of the tissue than is necessary. Once the skin cancer is removed  the surgical wound may be repaired with stitches or it may be allowed to heal naturally. The cure rate for Mohs surgery is about 98 percent to 99 percent in most cases.
actinic keratosis;Unlike most skin conditions caused by the sun ÿactinic keratosis  which is sometimes called solar keratosis ÿis usually benign. At least 90 percent of these small  scaly skin spots will not turn into cancer. Actinic keratosis is an abnormal growth of cells caused by long-term damage from the sun. ;Actinic keratoses are often referred to in the plural form because people rarely develop just one. The small bumps typically appear on the parts of the body that are most exposed to the sun's rays such as the ears  nose  cheeks  temples and bald scalp. They can also appear on the forearms and backs of hands and usually look like rough bumps or patches on the skin. They often have a sandpaper-like feel to them. They start off small and slowly grow in size until they?re about an eighth to a quarter of an inch. The spots don?t cause pain  but they occasionally itch or feel tender. The growths may be scaly or crusty or they may resemble warts  although they're not quite as thick;caused by the accumulation of sun exposure over time. It's very common in adults 55 years old and over  especially those who have spent a lot of time working or exercising outdoors. It's slightly more common in men than women because they are less likely to use adequate sun protection. Age is a risk factor as is having fair  light-colored skin. But the incidence of skin cancer is on the rise among younger people  so it is possible for AK to occur in people in their 30s and 40s. People with olive or darker-colored skin can also develop skin cancer. ;Patients will often notice a rough spot that isn't going away and ask their dermatologist to take a look at it. Most of the time  the doctor can make a visual diagnosis  and in the cases that are less obvious  will do a biopsy. The spots are only biopsied if they look like an actual skin cancer or if they don?t respond to initial treatment;Topical destruction: AK primarily affects the top layer of the skin  so when the patient has only one or a few isolated growths  the dermatologist will usually destroy that area of the skin. The most common way to do this freezing therapy with liquid nitrogen  which is either sprayed on the growth or applied with a cotton applicator. Fluorouracil: The most commonly prescribed cream is fluorouracil  also known as 5-FU (brand name S Efudex  Carac  or Tolak). It works by blocking the growth of abnormal cells that cause the skin condition. It is also used in the treatment of breast cancer  colorectal cancer  gastric adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer and other internal cancers. miquimod: This is a type of topical immunotherapy that helps the patient's immune system to fight off the pre-cancerous lesions. While imiquimod creams (brand names Aldara and Zyclara) work by a different process than fluorouracil  they have similar results: redness and irritation that eventually heal to reveal smooth  new skin. Diclofenac: This nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory gel (brand name Solaraze) is less irritating than other creams  but it's also much less popular. Ingenol mebutate gel: The newest topical treatment for AK  ingenol mebutate gel (brand name Picato)  requires only a few applications over two to three days. Multiple lesions can also be addressed using photodynamic light therapy  which involves applying a liquid drug called a photosensitizer to the skin.
Dermatofibroma;A dermatofibroma is a commonÿbenignÿfibrousÿnoduleÿusually found on the skin of the lower legs. A dermatofibroma is also called aÿcutaneousÿfibrous histiocytoma. Dermatofibromas are mostly seen in adults. People of every ethnicity can develop dermatofibromas. Ordinary dermatofibromas are more common in women than in men  although some histologic variants are more commonly identified in males. ;It is not clear if dermatofibroma is a reactive process or a trueÿneoplasm. Theÿlesionsÿare composed ofÿproliferatingÿfibroblasts.ÿHistiocytesÿmay also be involved. hey are sometimes attributed to minor trauma including insect bites  injections  or a rose thorn injury  but not consistently. Multiple dermatofibromas can develop in patients with altered immunity such as HIV  immunosuppression  or autoimmune conditions. ;"It is not clear if dermatofibroma is a reactive process or a trueÿneoplasm.

Multiple dermatofibromas can develop in patients with altered immunity such as HIV  immunosuppression  or autoimmune conditions.
";"A dermatofibroma usually presents as a solitary firmÿpapuleÿor nodule on a limb. A dermatofibroma can occur anywhere on the skin. Dermatofibroma size varies from 0.5?1.5 cm diameter; most lesions are 7?10 mm diameter. A dermatofibroma is tethered to the skin surface and mobile over subcutaneous tissue. The overlying skin dimples on pinching the lesion ? the dimple or pinch sign. Colour may be pink to light brown in white skin  and dark brown to black in dark skin; some appear paler in the centre. Dermatofibromas do not usually cause symptoms  but they are sometimes painful  tender  or itchy.";A dermatofibroma is harmless and seldom causes any symptoms. Usually  only reassurance is needed. If it is nuisance or causing concern  the lesion can be removed surgically.ÿRecurrenceÿis common as the lesion often extends beyond the clinical margin. Cryotherapy  shave biopsy and laser treatments are rarely completely successful.
